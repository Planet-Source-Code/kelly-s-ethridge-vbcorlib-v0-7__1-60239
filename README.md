## VBCorLib v0\.7


</div>

### Description

VBCorLib v0.7 is a massive library of classes that duplicate much of the functionality found in the mscorlib.dll of the Dot NET framework. This has been an ongoing project and I have finally gotten some time to add even more capabilities. New additions include all of the Calendars found in Dot NET, Console capabilities, and Registry manipulation. This library is too big to attempt to explain here, so there is a support website with documentation located at www.kellyethridge.com/vbcorlib. There is a set of unit tests included with this code and they require SimplyVBUnit v1.4.x (located on PSCode) in order to be run. The tests themselves can also serve as a guide for how to use most of the classes and interfaces. The unit tests are not required to compile the library.
 
### More Info
 
You will need to be able to register type libraries that are included, and you will need SimplyVBUnit v1.4.x in order to load and run the unit tests.
