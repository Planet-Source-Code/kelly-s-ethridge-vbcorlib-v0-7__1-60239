<H4>Values</H4>
<DL>
<DT><I>FirstDay</I></TD>
<DD> The first defined week that contains the first day of
 January is considered the first week of the year.
 </DD>
<DT><I>FirstFullWeek</I></TD>
<DD> The first defined week that contains 7 days of
 January is considered the first week of the year.
 </DD>
<DT><I>FirstFourDayWeek</I></TD>
<DD> The first defined week that contains the first
 4 days of January is considered the first week of the year.
 </DD>
</DL>
<H4>Remarks</H4>
<P> When a full week of 7 days from January is required, the week
 may not contain January 1st to 6th, since up to the first 6 days of
 January may exist in the same week and the week would not have 7 days
 from January in it as it may contain parts of the previous December.
 Those days would not count towards the number of weeks in the year.
